## Description

The RecipeBook is a Java library that allows you to create and manage cooking recipes and their ingredients. It provides an easy-to-use API for creating recipes, adding ingredients, calculating calories, and searching for recipes based on ingredients.

## Features

The RecipeBook management system offers the following features:

1. Create and manage cooking recipes with multiple RecipeIngredients.
2. Add or update RecipeIngredients to existing recipes.
3. Get RecipeIngredients for a given ingredient or ingredient name.
4. Remove RecipeIngredients from recipes.
5. Calculate the total calories for a cooking recipe.
6. Get the number of ingredients in a cooking recipe.
7. Find recipes containing specific ingredients.
8. Find recipes with a specified number of ingredients or fewer.
9. Find recipes with the lowest number of calories.

## Prerequisites

To use the RecipeBook library, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Installation

1. Clone the RecipeBook repository to your local machine (if you haven't already).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RecipeBook.git
$ cd RecipeBook
```
## Usage
 
 To compile and run the code locally

```bash
$ javac TestRecipeBook.java 
$ java TestRecipeBook
```
Follow the prompts in the command-line interface to interact with the RecipeBook management system. You can create recipes, add ingredients, find recipes based on ingredients, and more.

Keep in my mind to create a package name and include the package name in all the classes.
